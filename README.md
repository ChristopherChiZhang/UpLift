# UpLift
### Overview:
A mood changer that plays a song to positively change someone's mood based on their facial expression. 

### Features:

### Components:
#### Software:
The project utilizes OpenCV to read each frame of the video input from the PiCamera. Once this is done it detects where the userâ€™s face is in the frame by pixel location. When a face is detected, a blue rectangle is drawn over the face to allow the user to 

#### Hardware:
For hardware a **Raspberry Pi 4** was used as well as a **PiCamera**, to allow for efficient and speedy processing of the video frames. These components were connected to a monitor, so that the user can see the live video feed, a graph of their emotions that was displayed using the **Matplotlib** visualization library, and hear the music playing.

### Demo:
#### 1. OpenCV detects the user's face and crops an image of their face

#### 2. Keras runs a model against the detected faces and determines a facial expression, the data is displayed using MatplotLib

#### 3. A song is played through the speakers attached to the Raspberry Pi to maintain or elevate the user's mood
